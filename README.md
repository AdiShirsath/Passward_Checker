To check if your password ever been hacked

Whenever you enter your password on any site or app, it is  send to server of that site, it may get intercepted by hacker.
so to be safe we create hash code from SHA1 algorithm and send only first 5 character of it to used API in our code 
This technique is called as k-anonymity which is used by big companies like Google, Facebook,  Netflix.

And, now without entering our exact password on any site  we can know if it is ever been hacked if it is then change it.
